/* Steps to Solve: First, find which artist has earned the most according to the InvoiceLines. Now use this artist to find 
which customer spent the most on this artist. For this query, you will need to use the Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Customer, 
Album, and Artist tables. Note, this one is tricky because the Total spent in the Invoice table might not be on a single product, 
so you need to use the InvoiceLine table to find out how many of each product was purchased, and then multiply this by the price
for each artist. */
